# Basic Banking Application 

### About The Project:
There are two types of users that interact with the application:<br />
- Manager: can login/logout, and add/delete customers
- Customer: can login/logout, deposit, withdraw, check balance, and conduct purchases
<br />
There are 3 customer membership levels: silver, gold, and platinum, that are updated based on a customer's balance that provide different benifits to the customer.
<br />
<br />
This application applies the state design pattern to change the customer membership levels.
